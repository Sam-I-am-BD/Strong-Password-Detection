# Strong-Password-Detection
## A regex to verify that a password meets the requirements.
This is the second project of chapter 7 in the Automate the Boring Stuff book. At first I tried to combine the password requirements into one or two regexes to no avail. Eventually I gave up and wrote one for each criteria. I wanted to run the function through a loop and wasn't sure if I could add all the regex variables into a list. Luckly I gave it a shot and it just works!
